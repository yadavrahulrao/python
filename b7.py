#sets are unordered , unchangeable , unindexed
#sets are unordered so this means in what order they could appear
# sets are unchangeable but we can add or remove items.

# duplicates are not aloowed in sets

# a = {"apple", "apple"}
# print(a)

# in sets true and 1 are considered as same and duplicates

# a = {True,1}
# print(a)

#in sets flase and 0  are considered as same and duplicates

# a = {False,0}
# print(a)

# we can use set() constructor to construct a set using double brackets 

# a = set(("apple"))
# print(a)

# access items using for loop

# a = {"apple" , "banana"}
# for x in a :
#   print(x)
